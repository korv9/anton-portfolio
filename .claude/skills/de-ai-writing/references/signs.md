# Signs of AI writing: full catalogue and fixes

Source: Wikipedia, *Signs of AI writing* (WikiProject AI Cleanup), September 2026 edition. The guide
is a field guide for spotting machine-written text. Here it is turned around: each sign comes with
what it looks like, the words to watch, and how a human writer would fix it. Signs that only apply
to Wikipedia markup (wikitext, citation templates, categories, edit summaries) are left out.

The numbering matches `scripts/check_ai_signs.py`.

## 1. Content

### 1.1 Undue emphasis on significance, legacy and broader trends

Ordinary facts get a sentence about why they matter, how they "reflect broader" trends, or their
"enduring legacy". Even mundane subjects (a railway station, a fish species) get puffed up.

Words to watch: stands/serves as, is a testament/reminder, a crucial/pivotal/vital/significant/key
role or moment, underscores/highlights its importance, reflects broader, symbolising its
ongoing/enduring/lasting, contributing to the, setting the stage for, marking/shaping the,
represents/marks a shift, key turning point, evolving landscape, focal point, indelible mark, deeply
rooted, "has generated debate about…", "prompted broader reflection on…".

Fix: delete the significance sentence, or replace it with a specific fact that shows the point.

Before: "The institute was established in 1989, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of regional
statistics." After: "The institute was set up in 1989. It was Spain's first regional statistics
office."

### 1.2 Canned emphasis on notability and media coverage

Proving importance by listing where something was covered, or describing the sources themselves.

Words to watch: independent coverage, local/national media outlets, trade publications,
cited/featured/profiled in, written by a leading expert, maintains an active social media presence.

Fix: say what the thing is or did. Cite coverage only as a source for a specific claim.

### 1.3 Superficial analysis

A participle clause tacked onto the end of a factual sentence that interprets it without adding
information: "…, highlighting its importance", "…, ensuring…", "…, reflecting…".

Words to watch: highlighting, underscoring, emphasising, ensuring, reflecting, symbolising,
contributing to, cultivating, fostering, encompassing, enhancing, showcasing, valuable insights,
align/resonate with.

Fix: cut the clause. If the interpretation matters, make it its own sentence with evidence.

Before: "The station has 8 tracks and 6 platforms, reflecting its continued relevance in the regional
transportation landscape." After: "The station has 8 tracks and 6 platforms."

### 1.4 Promotional, advert or travel-brochure language

Neutral subjects written up like a hotel listing or a press release.

Words to watch: boasts a, vibrant, rich (culture/heritage/history), profound, enhancing, showcasing,
exemplifies, commitment to, natural beauty, nestled, in the heart of, groundbreaking, renowned,
featuring, diverse array, breathtaking, stunning, world-class, seamless, state-of-the-art.

Fix: replace the adjective with the fact that would earn it, or drop it.

Before: "Nestled in the heart of the old town, the café boasts a diverse array of pastries." After:
"The café is on the main square and sells about twenty kinds of pastry."

### 1.5 Vague attributions and overgeneralised opinions

Opinions hung on unnamed authorities, or one source presented as many.

Words to watch: industry reports, observers have cited, experts argue, some critics argue, several
sources (when there are one or two), studies show, widely regarded, "such as" before what is
actually a complete list.

Fix: name the source, or state the claim as your own view, or cut it.

### 1.6 Formulaic "challenges and future prospects" endings

"Despite its [praise], X faces several challenges… Despite these challenges, X continues to
thrive…", often in a closing "Challenges" or "Future outlook" section.

Fix: if a problem is real, state it plainly where it belongs. Drop the optimistic wrap-up.

### 1.7 Leads that define the title as a thing

"X refers to…" or "The List of Y is a curated compilation of…" for topics or lists.

Fix: start with the subject itself. "A catchment area is the area a hospital draws patients from."

### 1.8 "X and Y" headings, "Awards and recognition"

Paired headings built to sound complete. Keep a heading only if the section needs it.

## 2. Language and grammar

### 2.1 High density of "AI vocabulary"

One or two of these is normal. Several in one piece of text is one of the strongest tells.

- 2023–mid-2024 set: additionally (especially opening a sentence), boasts, bolstered, crucial, delve,
  emphasising, enduring, garner, intricate/intricacies, interplay, key (adjective), landscape
  (abstract), meticulous, pivotal, underscore, tapestry, testament, valuable, vibrant.
- Mid-2024–2025 set: align with, bolstered, crucial, emphasising, enhance, enduring, fostering,
  highlighting, pivotal, showcasing, underscore, vibrant.
- Newer models: emphasising, enhance, highlighting, showcasing.

Fix: use the ordinary word or cut. "Additionally" → start the sentence without it, or "Also".
"Crucial" → "important", or explain why. "Landscape" → name the actual thing. Don't just swap in a
synonym: the guide warns that the word is a symptom; the padding is the problem.

### 2.2 Avoiding "is", "are" and "has"

Dressing up a plain verb.

Words to watch: serves as, stands as, marks, functions as, operates as, represents, boasts /
features / maintains / offers (meaning "has"), refers to, "ventured into politics as a candidate"
(was a candidate), "began his career as" (was).

Fix: use is/are/has. "Gallery 825 serves as LAAA's exhibition space. The gallery features four
separate spaces" → "Gallery 825 is LAAA's exhibition space. It has four galleries."

### 2.3 Vague connection or association

"was associated with leadership of", "in connection with", "connected to" where a plain relationship
is known. Fix: state the relationship. "In 2017 she was CEO of ExampleCorp."

### 2.4 Negative parallelisms

Correcting a misconception nobody raised.

- "Not only … but also …", "It's not just X, it's Y", "This isn't A, it's B"
- "Not X, but Y", "X is not a mirror but a portal"
- "No X, no Y, just Z"
- "Y rather than X" (overused; fine occasionally)

Fix: state the positive claim alone. "It's not just a coffee shop, it's a gathering place" → "People
stay for hours." Keep a contrast only when a reader really would assume the opposite.

### 2.5 Rule of three

Triplets of adjectives or short phrases used to sound thorough: "fast, reliable, and secure";
"learn, connect, and grow". Fix: keep lists that are really lists of facts; otherwise pick the one
item that matters, or two. Vary rhythm.

### 2.6 Elegant variation

Cycling through synonyms to avoid repeating a noun ("the artist… the painter… the creative… the
visionary"). Fix: repeat the plain noun, or use a pronoun.

## 3. Style and formatting

### 3.1 Title Case headings

"Impact Of Technology And Digitalization". Fix: sentence case, unless house style says otherwise.

### 3.2 Overuse of boldface

Bolding key phrases throughout, "key takeaways" style. Fix: bold nothing in body prose, or at most a
term at its definition.

### 3.3 Inline-header vertical lists

Bullets that start with a bold label and a colon: "Scalability: The system…". Fix: turn into prose,
or a plain list without labels, or a real table if the data is tabular.

### 3.4 Overuse of em dashes

LLMs use em dashes where people use commas, colons, parentheses or full stops, often spaced " — "
for punch. Claude in particular uses more than professional writers do. Fix: rewrite the sentence
with ordinary punctuation. Don't swap in an en dash or hyphen; that keeps the pattern. One or two in
a long piece is fine.

### 3.5 Emoji as formatting

Emoji in front of headings or bullets. Fix: remove.

### 3.6 Unusual small tables

Two- or three-row tables that would read better as one sentence.

### 3.7 Curly quotes and apostrophes

Mixed curly (“ ” ’) and straight quotes. Match the surrounding text's convention. (Word processors
also produce curly quotes, so this alone proves nothing.)

### 3.8 Thematic breaks between every section

`---` between every section. Remove unless the format needs them.

## 4. Text meant for the chat user

### 4.1 Collaborative communication left in

"I hope this helps", "Certainly!", "Great question", "Let me know if…", "Would you like me to…",
"Here is a…", "In this section, we will discuss…". Fix: delete.

### 4.2 Knowledge-cutoff disclaimers and speculation about gaps

"As of my last update…", "While specific details are limited…", "not widely documented/disclosed",
"based on available information", "maintains a low profile", followed by guesses about what the
missing information "likely" is. Fix: if something genuinely is unknown, say so once, concretely,
and tell the reader what to do: "Opening hours aren't posted; call ahead." Never pad the gap with
speculation.

### 4.3 Placeholders

"[Your Name]", "[Describe the section]", "INSERT_URL", "2025-XX-XX". Fix: fill in or remove.

## 5. Older-model habits (still worth avoiding)

### 5.1 Didactic disclaimers

"It's important to note/remember/consider", "It is worth noting", "may vary", "keep in mind". Fix:
state the thing. "Hours may vary" → "Hours change in winter."

### 5.2 Section summaries

Paragraphs that end by restating themselves; openers like "In summary", "In conclusion", "Overall",
"Ultimately". Fix: end on the last new fact.

## 6. What human writing does instead

From the guide's "Signs of human writing":

- Plain is/has sentences: "there is a", "it has a".
- Plain words: wrote (not authored), moved (not relocated), used (not utilised), tried (not
  attempted), died (not passed away), before (not prior to), to (not in order to).
- Definite statements where true: "is the only", "was the first", "one of the best".
- Ordinary hedges and intensifiers: "very", "perhaps", "tends to".
- Specific, unusual facts. AI text regresses to the generic ("a revolutionary titan of industry");
  human text keeps the odd detail ("inventor of the first train-coupling device").

## 7. Not signs: don't "fix" these

The guide lists these as ineffective indicators. Changing them wastes effort and can make text
worse:

- Perfect grammar.
- Mixing casual and formal registers.
- "Bland" or formal prose in general, or long words in general.
- A single transition word on its own.
- Unsourced content.
- Correct formatting.

Quoted material (a real person's words, a title, a source) is never rewritten to remove signs.

# Web Interface Guidelines

Review files for compliance with Web Interface Guidelines.

## How It Works

1. Read the guidelines in `references/guidelines.md`
2. Read the specified files (or prompt user for files/pattern)
3. Check against all rules in the guidelines
4. Output findings in the terse `file:line` format

## Guidelines Source

The rules are baked in at `references/guidelines.md`, a copy of
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines/main/command.md`
(commit and update steps in `.claude/skills/README.md`). Read that file; do not fetch the URL
during a review.

## Usage

When a user provides a file or pattern argument:
1. Read `references/guidelines.md`
2. Read the specified files
3. Apply all rules from the guidelines
4. Output findings using the format specified in the guidelines

If no files specified, ask the user which files to review.

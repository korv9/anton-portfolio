"""Bridge a blinded slot reading to a `direction` SlotChange.

`direction.py` is pure: it classifies a SlotChange whose rungs are already known.
This module is the honest translation from what a reading actually reports --
`present` / `absent` / `uncertain` and a verbatim quote (see
`measurement.slot_reading`) -- into that input, using the hand-annotated source
slot for the part it attaches to, its kind, and its baseline determinacy or
modality rung.

The comparison is source-anchored: a child reading is compared to the source
slot the corpus annotated, the same grain `reporting.runs.comparison_rows`
already lines up. Insertion of a slot that the source never had is therefore out
of scope here and reported as such, not invented.

What it will not do is guess. A binary present/absent reader cannot see a
`specific -> vague` step on the determinacy ladder (DIRECTION.md), and it cannot
see an actor scope narrowing while the actor is still named. Those return
`observable = False` with a reason, never `neutral`. Calling an unseen weakening
`neutral` would hide exactly the generation this project exists to catch, so the
count vector is built only from observable changes and the unobservable ones are
reported alongside it.
